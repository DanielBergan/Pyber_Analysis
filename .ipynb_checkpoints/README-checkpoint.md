# Pyber_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to anaylise ride-sharing data and determine how the data differs between urban, suburban, and rural areas.

## Results

### Summary DateFrame Analysis

Rural areas have far fewer  total drivers as well as total rides than urban or suburban areas. However, in rural citys the average fare per 
ride is slightly higher and the average fare per driver is much higher.![This is an image.]

### Multiple-Line Chart Analysis

Looking at this graph it can be seen that throughout the first four months of the year the urban areas have higher weekly average fares than 
suburban and rural combined. Also, there is a collective increase in fares across all city type in the weeks leading up to the beginning of 
March. The suburban areas stand out in th latter part of April experiencing an increase in fares where urban and rural city types both show
a slight decrease in fares.![This is an image.]

## Project Summary

The data suggests that there is need for increasing total drivers in suburban and rural areas as the average fare per driver in those city type
is high compared to urban cities. The company could also increase the cost of fares in urban areas as the demand is very high. Finally, decreasing 
the amount of drivers in urban areas would address the disparity among city types.
